                        <h3>Rwanda’s Women Access To Finance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although the Government of Rwanda and its developmental partners support Women and Girls, multiple problems are immense. In the line of Women and Girls socially and economically empowered, Delight Rwanda has initiated projects advocating for them and providing financial support through Rwanda Women’s Access to Finance projects, farming, and vocational and technical training.
                            Before women are granted financial support, they must complete a three-month training program teaching basic business guidelines (how to determine business income, make personal savings for future expenses, and the benefits of reinvesting profits into businesses) and healthy, day-to-day living strategies.
                            Through this project, women were obliged to open up an account with micro-finance and get financed with $150 as startup capital. More than 89% of the beneficiaries gradually increased the business profit to $740 in one year. Even illiterate mothers who lack formal education can start successful small businesses, and generate a steady source of income for their families. Rwanda Women's Access to Finance has empowered over 200 women to take control of their financial futures.

                        <h3>Shelter For Homeless Children</h3>
                        <p>
                            Delight Rwanda considers street children as a category of children in need of special protection. It also considers street children as vulnerable children, with a high commitment to the child’s rights protection. The Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion of Rwanda estimates that there are about 7,000 street children in the country while close to 300,000 live in families where a minor is the head of the household. The economic challenges, domestic violence, parental irresponsibility, and broken family relationships have exacerbated the situation of street children.<br />
                            Since May 2022, Delight Rwanda has started a Shelter for Homeless Children project, which aims to improve the lives of street children by reintegrating them into families or foster care and supporting them to have access to education through empowering their families for sustainable livelihoods. This project has supported the street children to access daily basic needs like catering food, clean drinking water, health care services, toilets, bath facilities, accommodation, mentorship, and take them back to school in Kigali, where we started with two sites of Kimisagara and Rwezamenyo in Nyarugenge District, Kigali City.<br />
                            Violence against children is a fundamental violation of their rights. Sexual, physical, and emotional violence has a devastating impact on health, education, and happiness, preventing children from contributing to society to their full potential. Further, the Shelter for Homeless Children projects intends to increase community awareness and participation in protecting and promoting children's rights, obligations, and responsibilities and to establish and implement mechanisms for early identification and mitigation of all forms of abuse and violence against children.

Young people are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis in terms of employment, education, training, and mental well-being.<br />

                        <p>
                            Human trafficking remains a global problem that makes people suffer physically and psychologically during and after transportation victims of human trafficking to other parts of the world. The government of Rwanda does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period, considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its anti-trafficking capacity. Delight Rwanda increased the efforts of national awareness and prevention campaigns; and organized sustainable care shelters for human trafficking victims.<br />
                            The Wiceceka Project (Don’t keep quiet) has achieved its mission of alerting young people (girls and boys) at 98 high schools in Rwanda about the forms and faces of human trafficking. Delight Rwanda has set mechanisms towards reducing poverty and unemployment among the youths, improving girl protection and educating/informing the mass community through media channels, and preventing and reporting Human Trafficking cases to the prior authorities.
