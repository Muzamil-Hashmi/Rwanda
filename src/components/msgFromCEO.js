                            The increasing complexity of social issues is placing a greater burden not only on governments, but also on individuals. Many people now feel that it is not possible to solve these problems by relying on public services alone. In response, more people want to do something to help solve society’s problems, and are showing increased interest in activities that make a social contribution. Companies have become more involved in activities that reflect a stronger awareness of their corporate social responsibility (CSR), and nonprofit and volunteer activities have also become well established. There is a growing movement to join hands and work together toward achieving a society sustained by mutual support.<br /><br />
                            Delight Rwanda’s most valuable asset is the network of people and organizations that we have created through our activities over the past six years. We know from experience that bringing people together creates synergies. Our priority is solving actual problems on the ground. We engage in lively discussions with nonprofit organizations, corporations, governments, international organizations, researchers, and volunteers to arrive at possible solutions, and to initiate and implement projects. Delight Rwanda strives to apply the knowledge and experience we have accumulated over the years, and in cooperation with others, works to solve the issues that confront our society today.<br /><br />
                            It is truly my honor to serve as the chair of Delight Rwanda. As an instructor myself, I have firsthand knowledge of the vital work the organization does to strengthen the relationships between our beneficiaries, partners, stakeholders and employees. I view my role on the board as representing instructional programs and ensuring the organization’s work continues.<br /><br />
                            We act as the stewards of the organization, exercising independent judgment in supervising management and safeguarding the interests of the organization. In fulfilling our role, we foster our organization environment built on integrity and provide management with guidance in pursuit of our shared goal and maximizing long-term programs. Our board’s diversity of thought and experience enhances our ability to oversee the strategic development of a successful global community, understanding and assessing Delight Rwanda’s competitive environment, and anticipating the business possibilities and challenges of tomorrow.<br /><br />
                            The board reviews aspects of Delight Rwanda’s strategy at every meeting, taking into account the opportunities for the beneficiaries. We contribute a forward-looking perspective by participating actively with management in an annual session dedicated to strategic planning. In reviewing the implementation and success of approved strategic and operating plans, we regularly monitor Delight Rwanda’s performance against strategic goals, approving financial expenditures and major transactions that align with our plan.<br /><br />
                            We take seriously our responsibility to oversee policies and processes to identify the principal risks to the Delight Rwanda’s vision and the systems implemented to manage them. The board reviews strategies for identifying, prioritizing and managing risk, and for clearly defining roles and responsibilities. We seek to ensure that management’s plans and activities are prudent and Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors focused on generating organization value within an appropriate and comprehensive policy framework.<br /><br />
                            All our efforts are marked by an emphasis on trust and integrity. Our goal is to nurture the positive values that are already well entrenched in Delight Rwanda’s culture and to reinforce the ethical principles on which its reputation and success are founded. We remain firmly committed to continuous improvement of Delight Rwanda’s strong and effective governance standards.<br /><br />
                            Delight Rwanda’s Board of Directors and the executive staff are proud to actively participate in the achievements and supporting vulnerable community and transforming their livelihood. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank management, all employees and volunteers for their strong contribution to the Delight Rwanda’s performance over the past year.
