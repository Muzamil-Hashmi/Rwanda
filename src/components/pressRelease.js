                <b>PRESS RELEASE:</b>&nbsp;
                <b><u>Launch of the Wiceceka Human Trafficking Project</u></b><br /><br />
                <b>Kigali, 06 March 2023</b> – Delight Rwanda launched on Monday 6, 2023, the Wiceceka Human
                Trafficking project at its headquarters located at Gasabo District, City of Kigali, Rwanda.This
                event serves as an opportunity to alert the community, especially young people, about human
                trafficking forms and tactics used by traffickers.<br /><br />
                The Delight Rwanda’s Executive Director Samson Gihana said: “In today’s society, many young
                people experience online and physical human trafficking threats every day from people they
                know/trust and sometimes from people they don’t know and it threatens their
                survival, development, and participation in society”. <b><i>It is in the recognition of these plights and
                    threats that Delight Rwanda has initiated the Wiceceka Human Trafficking project(Don’t
                    ‘keep quiet Human Trafficking.</i></b><br /><br />
                “As we are launching this project today, the project survey conducted by Delight Rwanda
                confirms that at least 80% of internet users in Rwanda and 40 % worldwide will aware of human
                trafficking through our online/digital campaign, 356 high schools will be reached out and 195 of
                hotels operators will be trained about human trafficking” Said Samson Gihana.<br /><br />
                The online campaign against human trafficking is designed to use online platforms to ensure
                that internet and social media users as the target group of the project as well as the community
                at large are aware of forms of human trafficking and its consequences.All our efforts are
                directed toward content creation alerting the community about human trafficking and illegal
                immigration.Among traffickers' most preferred ways of finding victims is posting fake job
                offers online, promising work opportunities, often in far-off lands.Such recruitment and
                coercion often occur through targeting on social media.<br /><br />
                The High school campaign outreach and the Hospitality Operators’ Training and Awareness of
                human trafficking are the best communication channels to reach the direct vulnerable
                beneficiaries. “The trainees will be focal persons to disseminate messages / information about
                human trafficking prevention and reporting the cases to their prior authorities.<br /><br />
                Human trafficking remains a global problem that makes people suffer physically and
                psychologically during and after transportation victims of human trafficking to other parts of the
                world.The government of Rwanda demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared to the
                previous years, considering the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on its anti - trafficking
                capacity.For this purpose, Delight Rwanda increased the efforts of national awareness and
                prevention campaigns; and organized sustainable care shelters for human trafficking victims.<br /><br />
